Build an app to show current weather by fetch data from OpenWeather Website. Use React Hooks to generate current weather when first rendering based on user's geolocation and then search for the target weather based on user's input. Generate loading notice while waiting data response with Loading.io website tool to create loading gif. The background image changes responsively with weather description.
